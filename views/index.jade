                | It’s time to fight clowns with clowns! Headlined by many of today’s top comedians, The Comedy Resistance is organizing a cross-country barnstormin’ tour across crucial congressional districts. Our goal is to defeat at least 24 of the red clowns sitting in those seats and take back the House of Representatives in 2018.

            | The Comedy Resistance is a political organization led by comedians, (and anyone who likes to laugh) dedicated to making positive change by activating citizens in districts across the country. We’re partnering with Swing Left and House Democratic candidates, who will help connect TCR and its members with ways to get involved and the most important actions we can take to help achieve our goal on Election Day next November.
